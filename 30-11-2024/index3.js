// Problem 2: Car Speeds
// You are given an array of cars, where each car has a model and speed (in km/h). 
// Your task is to identify which cars are exceeding 120 km/h and which are safe (â‰¤120 km/h). 
// Store the safe cars and speeding cars in separate arrays. Use a for loop and a if else statement.
